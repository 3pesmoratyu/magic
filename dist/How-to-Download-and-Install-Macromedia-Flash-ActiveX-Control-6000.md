In this article, we will show you how to download and install Macromedia Flash ActiveX Control 6.0.0.0 on your Windows computer.
 
## Step 1: Download the Flash Player ActiveX Control from Sothink site
 
Since Adobe has removed the download links for older versions of Flash Player from its official website, you will need to find an alternative source to get the Flash Player ActiveX Control 6.0.0.0 file. One of the possible sources is the Sothink site, which provides a link to download the file for its SWF Decompiler software.
 
To download the file from Sothink site, you will need to use Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, as other browsers may not support ActiveX controls. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open Microsoft Internet Explorer and go to [https://www.sothink.com/support/flash.htm](https://www.sothink.com/support/flash.htm).
2. Click on the link that says "Click here to download the Flash Player ActiveX control from Sothink site".
3. Save the file to your desired location on your computer.

## Step 2: Install the Flash Player ActiveX Control
 
After you have downloaded the file, you will need to install it on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Locate the file that you have downloaded and double-click on it to run it.
2. You may see a security warning dialog box due to the lack of security of Flash itself. Just ignore it and click on "Run" or "Yes" to continue.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
4. Restart your computer if prompted.

## Step 3: Verify the installation
 
To verify that you have successfully installed Macromedia Flash ActiveX Control 6.0.0.0 on your computer, you can do one of the following:

- Open Microsoft Internet Explorer and go to [https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html). You should see a message that says "Flash Player is pre-installed in Internet Explorer in Windows 8". If you click on "Check Now", you should see that your version is 6.0.0.0.
- Open Sothink SWF Decompiler or any other Flash-related software that requires Macromedia Flash ActiveX Control 6.0.0.0. You should be able to use it without any problems.

## Note: Adobe Flash end of support on December 31, 2020
 
Please note that Adobe Flash will no longer be supported after 2020, and Microsoft plans to remove Flash from Windows entirely by the end of 2020[^1^]. Other browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari are also planning on removing Adobe Flash in the same timeframe[^1^]. Therefore, we do not recommend using Macromedia Flash ActiveX Control 6.0.0.0 or any other version of Flash Player for any purposes other than those that are absolutely necessary.
 
If you need to use Flash content on the web, you should switch to a browser that supports HTML5 or other modern web technologies instead.
